# ZAP Security Report

## Summary
- Total Alerts: 40

### Authentication Request Identified
- **Risk Level:** 0
- **URL:** http://localhost:8000/login
- **Description:** The given request has been identified as an authentication request. The 'Other Info' field contains a set of key=value lines which identify any relevant fields. If the request is in a context which has an Authentication Method set to "Auto-Detect" then this rule will change the authentication to match the request identified.
- **Solution:** This is an informational alert rather than a vulnerability and so there is nothing to fix.

### Cross-Domain Misconfiguration
- **Risk Level:** 2
- **URL:** http://local.adguard.org/?ts=1732720713232&name=AdGuard%20Extra&name=AdGuard%20Popup%20Blocker&type=user-script
- **Description:** Web browser data loading may be possible, due to a Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) misconfiguration on the web server.
- **Solution:** Ensure that sensitive data is not available in an unauthenticated manner (using IP address white-listing, for instance).
Configure the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" HTTP header to a more restrictive set of domains, or remove all CORS headers entirely, to allow the web browser to enforce the Same Origin Policy (SOP) in a more restrictive manner.

### Cross-Domain Misconfiguration
- **Risk Level:** 2
- **URL:** http://local.adguard.org/?ts=1732720713232&type=content-script&dmn=localhost:8000&url=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8000%2F&app=chrome.exe&css=2&js=1&rel=1&rji=1&sbe=1
- **Description:** Web browser data loading may be possible, due to a Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) misconfiguration on the web server.
- **Solution:** Ensure that sensitive data is not available in an unauthenticated manner (using IP address white-listing, for instance).

### CSP: style-src unsafe-inline
- **Risk Level:** 2
- **URL:** http://localhost:8000/
- **Description:** Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks. Including (but not limited to) Cross Site Scripting (XSS), and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page â€” covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.
- **Solution:** Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is properly configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.
